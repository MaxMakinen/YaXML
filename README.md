# YaXML
Yet another XML parser. Small and simple XML parser built in C.
Built for a school project at Hive Helsinki.
Follows restrictions given by task.
School curriculum heavily restricts which libraries we're allowed to use.
We create our own library of functions called libft and this project is made using mine.
